    <h1>Question 1</h1>
    <p>Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and
        "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5</p>
        <script src="scripts/question 1.js"></script>
        <h2> Question 2</h2>
        <p>Destructure the following object:
             const student = {
               name: " Helsinki",
              age: 24,
               projects: {
                 diceGame: "Two player dice game using JavaScript",
              },
            };</p>
            <script src="scripts/question 2.js"></script>
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p>Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy.
               Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want toadd a few more.Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, 
                and add somenew products into it.</p>
                <script src="scripts/question 3.js"></script>
                <h4>Question 6</h4>
                <p>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
                   The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
                   Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a specialhandling for a non-numeric input in this task.
                  
                   while (true) {
                     let num = prompt(`Enter the number`);
                     if (num > 100) {
                     console.log("Number: " + num);
                       continue;
                     } else {
                       console.log("Number: " + num);
                       break;
                     }
                  }</p>
