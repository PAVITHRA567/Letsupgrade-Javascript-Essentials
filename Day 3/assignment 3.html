    <h> Question 1</h>
    <p>Take a number from a user and write a function which checks whwther the number is even or odd.assign the result to variabke and log that variabke the console</p>
    <script>
        let number = Number(prompt("Enter a  number: "));
        let string;
        if(+number % 2 == 0)
        {
            string = "even";
        }
        else{
            string = "odd";
        }
        console.log(`The number entered is ${number} and  is ${string}`);
    </script>

    <h> question 2</h>
    <p>write a program which will take OS name and version from the user separated by space.then log the OS name and version on the console. </p>
<script>
     let version = prompt("Enter OS name and version seprated by space.");
        console.log(`The OS name is ${version.split(" ")[0]} and version is ${version.split(" ")[1]}`);
</script>

<h> Question 3</h>
<p> write a program to take marks as input from the user and grade him accordingly.use conditional statement.also the same code using switch or ternary</p>
<script>
    let marks = prompt("Enter your marks.");
            /* Using nested if-else */
        
            let grade;

            }else if(+marks > 80){
                grade = "A";
            }else if(+marks > 70){
                grade = "B+";
            }else if(+marks > 60){
                grade = "C";
            }else if(+marks > 50){
                grade = "D";
            }else if(+marks > 40){
                grade = "E";
            }else if(+marks > 0)
                grade = "Fail";
            else{
                grade = "Incorrect marks."
            }

        console.log(`Marks are ${marks} and grade is ${grade}.`); 

        /* Using ternary operator. */
        grade = (+marks > 80) ? "A" : (+marks > 70) ? "B" : (+marks > 60) ? "C": (+marks > 50) ? "D" : (+marks > 40) ? "E" : "Fail" ;
        console.log(`Marks are ${marks} and grade is ${grade}.`); 

        /*Using Switch case */

       switch(true){
            case (+marks > 80) :
                grade = "A";
                break;
